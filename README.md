Wordpress Plugin: Display images as Materialize Material boxes.

Material box is a material design implementation of the Lightbox plugin. When a user clicks on an image that can be enlarged, Material box centers the image and enlarges it in a smooth, non-jarring manner. To dismiss the image, the user can either click on the image again, scroll away, or press the ESC key.
